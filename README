OpenLink HTML5 WebDB to XMLA bridge
===================================

The OpenLink HTML5 WebDB to XMLA bridge is a Web browser extension
that enables the development of database-driven HTML5 (Javascript)
applications, without binding to specific back-end database engines
for data storage and access.

XMLA is an HTTP based protocol for performing data access against
multi-dimensional (OLAP and ROLAP) and tabular (Relational Databases)
data sources.

This extension only deals with the tabular data sources that are
directly accessible via XMLA or via ODBC/JDBC bridges.
